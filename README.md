# Tictactoe-in-Linux
This Bash script implements a Tic Tac Toe game on the Linux platform. It reads a set of moves from an input file, validates the moves, and simulates the game based on the provided moves. The script includes error checks for command-line arguments and input file validity. It utilizes arrays, functions, conditional statements, loops, and string manipulation to handle game logic, printing the board, checking for a winner, and ensuring valid moves. The code promotes modularity and provides error messages for various scenarios.
